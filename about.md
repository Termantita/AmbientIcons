# Ambient Icons

Changes the color of the icons based on the current color of the screen/background (like <cr>YouTube</c> Ambient Mode).

Can cause performance issues with <cy>Globed</c>.

- Ported to Android (<cy>opaque colors</c> issue - for some reason colors aren't like in PC)

- Adjust where to pick the colors in the mod's settings (X and Y axes)
- **BG color picker** - Pick the color from the BG wihout objects affecting the picked color

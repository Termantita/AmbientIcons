# Ambient Icons

Changes the color of the icons based on the current color of the screen or background (like <cr>YouTube</c> Ambient Mode).

Can cause performance issues with <cy>Globed</c>.

<cr>THIS VERSION IS MARKED AS BETA, SO BUGS MAY OCCUR</c>. Feel free to create an issue on the GitHub repository or DM me in Discord for reporting bugs - not_terma

Player flash option was REMOVED for now. Use 0ms update time for similar results.

## Features

- Ported to Android (<cy>opaque colors</c> issue - for some reason colors aren't like in PC)
- Ambient mode for main color, secondary color, dual color, wave trail and glow

Featured with different pickers:
- **Screen picker** - Adjust where to pick the colors in the mod's settings (X and Y axes)
- **BG color picker** - Pick the color from the BG without objects affecting the picked color
- **Player follow color picker** - Autoadjust by following the player where to pick the colors
